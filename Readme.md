## Steps

- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- Run `npx expo prebuild --clean` to create a build
- Run `npx expo run:ios`
- The project opens in an iOS simulator if XCode is installed
- Initially for the simulator set the location to: Latitude : `18.5204` Longitude : `73.8567` as our app runs for PUNE
- If the app still doesn't work as expected, please stop the server and follow steps 2 & 3
